/// @brief Provides pointer management.
///
/// Wraps the owned array pointer to guarantee its automatic deletion when the object goes out
/// of scope. Note that this is NOT for an array of pointers, but for a pointer to an array.
///
/// You can copy and assign between AutoArrayPtr objects. The ownership is always passed along.
/// If trying to assign to a AutoArrayPtr that already wraps an array pointer, that pointer will
/// be deleted before the next one is assigned.
///
/// We will protect against using nullptr contained array pointers with asserts to catch programmer
/// errors. We will depend on callers using the new [] operator to throw exceptions on failure
/// to protect at runtime.
///
/// This object cannot be used in a container that requires that the objects have a copy
/// constructor and assignment operator that have a const parameter. This means that it wants
/// to make an exact copy. This is not the case with this object as the the AutoArrayPtr
/// objects being used for the copy construction or assignment are changed. These AutoArrayPtr
/// objects lose the pointers they contain when the other object is initialized with it.
///
/// Here are some guidelines for using the AutoArrayPtr.
/// - Never create a AutoArrayPtr pointer using new. This defeats its purpose.
/// - Never use the AutoArrayPtr to wrap a pointer since AutoArrayPtr uses delete [] and not
///   delete.
/// - If used properly, there is only ever one instance of a AutoArrayPtr that contains a
///   particular array pointer. There is no reference counting that would enable it to be a
///   shared pointer object.
/// - They can be passed around as parameters. If they are passed as a const reference you will
///   still be be able to access the contained array pointer after the call, but only as type
///   const T*. The const will have the compiler prevent any of the non const methods from
///   being called on it. You could always trick it by doing something like
///   delete AutoArrayPtr.Get() but this is improper usage.
/// - Do not instantiate AutoArrayPtr on a const-qualified type (you might get indecipherable
///   compile errors).

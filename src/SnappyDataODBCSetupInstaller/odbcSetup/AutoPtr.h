/// @brief Provides pointer management.
///
/// Wraps the owned pointer to guarantee its automatic deletion when the object goes out of
/// scope.
///
/// You can copy and assign between AutoPtr objects. The ownership is always passed along.
/// If trying to assign to a AutoPtr that already wraps a pointer, that pointer will be
/// deleted before the next one is assigned.
///
/// We will protect against using nullptr contained pointers with asserts to catch programmer
/// errors. We will depend on callers using the new operator to throw exceptions on failure to
/// protect at runtime.
///
/// This object cannot be used in a container that requires that the objects have a copy
/// constructor and assignment operator that have a const parameter. This means that it wants
/// to make an exact copy. This is not the case with this object as the the AutoPtr
/// objects being used for the copy construction or assignment are changed. These AutoPtr
/// objects lose the pointers they contain when the other object is initialized with it.
///
/// Here are some guidelines for using the AutoPtr.
/// - Never create a AutoPtr pointer using new. This defeats its purpose.
/// - Never use the AutoPtr to wrap a pointer to an array since AutoPtr uses delete
///   and not delete [].
/// - If used properly, there is only ever one instance of a AutoPtr that contains a
///   particular pointer. There is no reference counting that would enable it to be a shared
///   pointer object.
/// - They can be passed around as parameters. If they are passed as a const reference you will
///   still be be able to access the contained pointer after the call, but only as type
///   const T*. The const will have the compiler prevent any of the non const methods from
///   being called on it. You could always trick it by doing something like
///   delete AutoPtr.Get() but this is improper usage.
/// - Do not instantiate AutoPtr on a const-qualified type (you might get indecipherable
///   compile errors).
